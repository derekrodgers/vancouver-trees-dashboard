# Vancouver Street Trees Dashboard

The **Vancouver Street Trees Dashboard** is an interactive Shiny app that enables users to:

- Filter street trees by **neighbourhood, height category, binomial species name, and common name**.
- Visualize tree distributions with a **heatmap** and **bar chart**.
- View detailed **data tables** for both species and individual trees, with interactive search and sorting.
- Access **Google Maps links** for individual tree locations.
- Access **Wikipedia Articles** for tree species.

The app is built using R and Shiny, with visualization support from `plotly` and `ggplot2`.
