# Vancouver Trees Dashboard

The **Vancouver Trees Dashboard** is an interactive R Shiny app that has:

- Filters for public trees by neighbourhood, height category, binomial species name, and common name.
- A live map that displays all tree locations, reactive to all filters.
- Reactive Google Street View, allowing a visual perspective on each tree.
- A table displaying aggreate tree counts by species.
- An "All Trees" table.
- Height distribution charts: (i) heights across all neighbourhoods and (ii) neighbourhoods x height category.
